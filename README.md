## **Challenge:** Classically inspired quantum error correction with noise-biased qubits.

When your quantum cats only knock things over in one direction, can you keep them under control with fewer resources? Discover a hardware-efficient path to fault tolerance with us.

Challenge materials are in `challenge/`.
